#INTELNVMI18NLIBRARY

Intel NVM I18N Library is an internationalization library supporting a subset
of internationalization functionality. 

GNU Make is used to build for Linux and Windows.
As such we recommend mingw_w64 and msys be used to build in a windows
environment. Both of which can be found at mingw.org
